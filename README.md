# 📊 Recent Projects

📞 Call Center Operator Efficiency Analysis

Developed a data analysis project to identify inefficient call center operators by evaluating key performance metrics and testing data-driven hypotheses.

Technologies Used: Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, SQL, Jupyter Notebook, statistical hypothesis testing, Tableau.

Key Responsibilities:

- Cleaned and transformed telecom data to calculate KPIs such as call drop rate, average wait time, and number of outgoing calls.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and segmentation to distinguish between efficient and inefficient operators.
- Conducted statistical hypothesis testing to validate relationships between operator behavior and performance.
- Created visual dashboards in Tableau to present findings and support decision-making.

Achievements:

- Confirmed key hypotheses linking long wait times and high call drop rates with poor operator performance.
- Proposed actionable recommendations such as enhanced training and call routing optimization.
- Delivered insights to support future predictive modeling for operator performance evaluation.

🛒 User Behavior Analysis for a Food Startup App

Analyzed user behavior data from a food delivery app to identify drop-off points in the sales funnel and assess the impact of a design change through an A/A/B test.
Technologies Used: Python, pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, SQL, Jupyter Notebook, statistics, A/B testing methodology.

Key Responsibilities:

- Cleaned and preprocessed mobile app event log data.
- Conducted funnel analysis to identify conversion bottlenecks.
- Performed statistical hypothesis testing (Z-test) to evaluate differences in engagement across control and experimental groups.
- Created visualizations of user flows and key KPIs to support findings.

Achievements:

- Identified a significant drop-off between product view and checkout stages.
- Provided evidence that the typography change had no statistically significant effect on conversion rates.
- Delivered actionable recommendations to improve the user journey and optimize app performance.

🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis

Analyzed global video game sales data to uncover trends and key factors influencing sales across platforms and regions.

Technologies Used: Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook, statistical testing.

Key Responsibilities:

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Explored trends by platform, genre, and region through statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Performed hypothesis testing to evaluate the relationship between user ratings and game sales.
- Delivered insights to support data-driven marketing and release strategies.

Achievements:

- Identified that sales in North America and Europe were strongly influenced by game genre and platform.
- Found no statistically significant correlation between user ratings and sales, guiding a shift in focus toward other performance drivers.
- Generated actionable insights that could help improve forecasting and market targeting for future releases.
