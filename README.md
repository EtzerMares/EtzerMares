I’ve spent a couple of years diving into the world of data analysis and I’m looking for ways to apply my knowledge and new skills. I have expertise in Python, SQL, R, HTML, Business Intelligence, among other things. I strive to keep learning new things all the time with the goal of growing in this field.
